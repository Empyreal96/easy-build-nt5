# Easy-Build GUI For Razzle
Just a small script I made and use when building NT5 for a quick lazy mans build. Adapted so others can use.

![MainMenu](https://github.com/Empyreal96/easy-build-nt5/raw/main/easy-build.png)

- **easy-build.cmd:**

  *What is it exactly?*

  - *It is an easy to use 'frontend' to the NT5 Razzle Build Environment and 4chan/OpenXP Patches*

  - *Easy to use (I hope)*

- How to use?

  Just double-click, it will ask for UAC, detect if user is 32 or 64 bit, then loads razzle + easy-build
