# Easy-Build-Env (ALPHA STAGE, NOT FINISHED)
Just a small script I made and use when building NT5 for a quick lazy mans build. Adapted so others can use.



- **easy-build.cmd:**

  *What is it exactly?*

  - *It is an easy to use 'frontend' to the NT5 Razzle Build Environment and 4chan/OpenXP Patches*

  - *Easy to use (I hope)*

- How to use?

  Just Right-click and Run As Administrator, the script loads razzle for you!
