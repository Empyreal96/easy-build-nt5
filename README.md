# Easy-Build GUI For Razzle
Just a small script I made and use when building NT5 for a quick lazy mans build. Adapted so others can use.

```
**What's new?**
	- Added checks so that the script cannot run without razzle present
	- Added checks so user cannot postbuild or make ISO with files missing (missing files not provided)
	- Added 'First Run' screen (it will only show on very first load)
	- Made sure we can load 64 bit env successfully
	- Added an 'info' page 
	- All options should work now
```



- **easy-build.cmd:**

  *What is it exactly?*

  - *It is an easy to use 'frontend' to the NT5 Razzle Build Environment and 4chan/OpenXP Patches*

  - *Easy to use (I hope)*

- How to use?

  Just double-click, it will ask for UAC, detect if user is 32 or 64 bit, then loads razzle + easy-build
